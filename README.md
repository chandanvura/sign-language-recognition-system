Sign language recognition systems represent a groundbreaking technological advancement that serves as a vital bridge between the deaf and hearing communities. This innovation facilitates real-time translation of sign language into spoken language and vice versa, fostering inclusivity and accessibility in our diverse society. Leveraging sophisticated computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the system meticulously analyzes hand movements, facial expressions, and body language to accurately interpret the meaning behind signs.

By utilizing advanced technology, the system seamlessly recognizes a broad spectrum of sign language styles and adapts to the unique habits of individual users. A camera captures sign language gestures in real-time, forming the core of the proposed system's three main stages: hand detection and tracking, feature extraction, and classification. The initial stage involves obtaining and tracking a hand region of interest using a skin color-based method. Subsequently, in the feature extraction stage, geometric and temporal features are employed to extract hand shape and motion characteristics. The final classification stage employs a support vector machine (SVM) to accurately recognize the conveyed sign language gestures.

The user-friendly interface and intuitive design of the sign language recognition system facilitate seamless integration into various devices and applications, including smartphones, laptops, and smart home assistants. This technological marvel opens up new avenues for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in education, employment, and social interaction. By enabling more effective and confident communication in a predominantly hearing world, the system empowers the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities, fostering diversity and inclusion within our society.
